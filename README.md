To Start Training the model, First load the robot in gazebo using l2.py launch file, then start com.py for the current and next state data, then run the appropriate RL script.



This project tackles the complex task of controlling a quadruped robot using
model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) within the ROS2 and Gazebo
simulation environment. Quadruped robots are versatile but face challenges
in adapting to dynamic environments as well as require complex control de-
sign to operate robustly in dynamic environments. The integration of ROS2
and Gazebo is crucial, serving as a bridge between simulation and real-world
deployment.Our solution combines MFRL with ROS2 and Gazebo, providing
an efficient platform for testing and transitioning learned policies to physical
robots. The ROS2 framework ensures streamlined communication, while
Gazebo offers a realistic simulation environment. This approach enhances
adaptability and autonomy, crucial for applications like search and rescue.The
significance lies in mitigating risks associated with direct experimentation on
physical robots. By allowing robots to learn and optimize control policies in
simulation, as real hardware is susceptible to damage when training the model in a real robot. This project explores an alternative solution for
quadruped robot control, addressing challenges posed by real-world complexities and advancing autonomous robotic systems.
