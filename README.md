This project tackles the complex task of controlling a quadruped robot using
model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) within the ROS2 and Gazebo
simulation environment. Quadruped robots are versatile but face challenges
in adapting to dynamic environments as well as require complex control de-
sign to operate robustly in dynamic environments. The integration of ROS2
and Gazebo is crucial, serving as a bridge between simulation and real-world
deployment.Our solution combines MFRL with ROS2 and Gazebo, providing
an efficient platform for testing and transitioning learned policies to physical
robots. The ROS2 framework ensures streamlined communication, while
Gazebo offers a realistic simulation environment. This approach enhances
adaptability and autonomy, crucial for applications like search and rescue.The
significance lies in mitigating risks associated with direct experimentation on
physical robots. By allowing robots to learn and optimize control policies in
simulation, our approach empowers them to adapt to unforeseen challenges
in real-world scenarios. This project introduced an alternative solution for
quadruped robot control, addressing challenges posed by real-world complex-
ities and advancing autonomous robotic systems.
1 Introduction
In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the intersection of planning and learning
methods is crucial for developing intelligent systems capable of adapting to complex environments.
This project, focuses on addressing challenges in controlling quadruped robots using model-free
reinforcement learning (MFRL) within the ROS2 and Gazebo simulation environment.Quadruped
robots [1], known for their versatility, encounter difficulties in adapting to dynamic environments.
The intricacies of designing robust control systems for such robots in dynamic settings necessitate
innovative approaches. Our project aims to integrate MFRL with the ROS2 and Gazebo platforms,
providing an efficient framework for testing and deploying learned policies onto physical robots.The
combination of ROS2 and Gazebo serves as a vital bridge between simulation and real-world deploy-
ment. ROS2 facilitates streamlined communication, while Gazebo provides a realistic simulation
environment. This approach enhances the adaptability and autonomy of quadruped robots, making
them well-suited for applications such as search and rescue operations.One of the key advantages
of our solution is the mitigation of risks associated with direct experimentation on physical robots.
Allowing robots to learn and optimize control policies in simulation empowers them to adapt to
unforeseen challenges in real-world scenarios.
